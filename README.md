##  Data Processing

1. Data Understanding: Before building models, it's essential to thoroughly understand the dataset. Begin by identifying variable types (continuous vs. categorical) and examining their distributions. For instance, in our dataset, the 'Material_Ref' feature may contain unwanted values starting with '00000,' which should be converted to null for improved data quality.

2. Handling Missing Values: Replace all non-positive values in the 'quantity tons,' 'selling_price,' and 'delivery_date_dif' columns with np.nan. Then, fill missing values in all columns using the median of each respective column.

3. Encoding and Data Transformation: Convert categorical variables, such as 'status' and 'Item type,' to numerical values using appropriate encoding techniques.

4. Skewness and Feature Scaling: Detect and address skewness in the data to achieve a more normal distribution, which can improve model performance. A log transformation is a commonly used technique for highly skewed continuous variables.

5. Outlier Handling: Use the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to detect outliers. Adjust outliers to align with the rest of the data, making the model more robust.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering

1. Visualizing Skewness: Plotting the data helps identify skewed features. Apply transformations if necessary to enhance model training effectiveness.

2. Outlier Visualization: Outliers may indicate errors or unique events. Handling them requires domain knowledge, and alternative methods may be needed for categorical variables (e.g., identifying rare categories).

3. Feature Enhancement: Some functions, such as outlier handling, may not apply to categorical features like 'width.' Consider different approaches for anomaly detection in such cases.
## Classification

1. Algorithm Assessment: Evaluate various algorithms based on accuracy, while considering the cost of false positives and negatives. Accuracy may not always be the ideal metric.

2. Algorithm Selection: Between RandomForestClassifier (97.4%) and ExtraTreesClassifier (97.6%), ExtraTreesClassifier is chosen due to its higher accuracy.

3. Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV to fine-tune model parameters, mitigating overfitting and optimizing performance. For ExtraTreesClassifier, the optimal parameters might include {'max_depth': 25, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 50}.

4. Success and Failure Classification: Define 'Won' as Success and 'Lost' as Failure, excluding other status values for focused classification.

5. Model Persistence: Save the trained model using a pickle file for easy loading and prediction in future applications.
## Regression

1. Algorithm Assessment: Similar to classification, evaluate multiple regression algorithms based on accuracy. The choice of the best metric depends on the problem's requirements.

2. Algorithm Selection: Choose RandomForestRegressor (91.6%) over ExtraTreesRegressor (91.2%) for its slightly better performance.

3. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model using GridSearchCV. Optimal parameters may include {'max_depth': 20, 'max_features': 'auto', 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 100}.

4. Model Persistence: Save the regression model to a pickle file for future use.
